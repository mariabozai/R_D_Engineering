Markup: 1. Explain the difference between a stack and a queue. Provide real life examples of
real-life scenarios where each of them are used appropriately.
        Stacks are based on the LIFO principle and queues are based on the FIFO principle. LIFO means "last in, first out", the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list. For exemple, when you're stacking plates one on top of the other, you usually take the top plate first when you need one. The last plate you placed on the stack is the first one to be removed. FIFO means "first in, first out", the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list. For instance, supermarket checkout queue is  based on this principle. The first customer to join the queue is the first one served by the cashier. As new customers join the queue, they line up behind the existing ones.
        2. What is the difference between an array and a linked list? Provide advantages and
disadvantages of each data structure.
        The primary distinction between arrays and linked lists lies in their underlying structures. Arrays are indexed-based data structures, where each element is associated with an index position. In contrast, linked lists rely on references, where each node contains the data and references to both the previous and next elements in the sequence. Arrays advantages are fast random access, memory efficiency, better cache locality and the disadvantages are fixed size, costly insertions and deletions, and inflexible resize. 
Linked lists advantages are dynamic size, efficient insertions and deletions, no wasted memory, and the disadvantages are no random access and extra memory overhead.
 
        3. What is HTTP? How is it different from HTTPS?
        HTTP is a protocol that enables data transmission via the world wide web. The most important difference between the two is that HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt connections between web browsers and servers. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP.
        
        4. Can you give some examples of common HTTP response codes?
        Some exemples of common HTTP response codes are 200 OK, 304 Not Modified, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 410 Gone and 502 Bad Gateway.
        
        5. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
        Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.
        
        6. How would you explain to a 5-year-old how the WWW works?
        Imagine the World Wide Web is like a giant library in the sky, filled with lots of books called websites. Each website is like a special book with its own stories and pictures.
        When you want to read a book (visit a website), you use a magic tool called a web browser, like a special pair of glasses. You type the name of the website (URL) you want to visit into your browser, and it helps you find the right book in the library.
        Now, the library (the internet) is like a huge network of roads. These roads connect all the libraries (servers) where the books (websites) are stored. When you type in a website name, your browser follows the roads to the right library and brings back the book you want to read.
        So, the World Wide Web is like a magical library in the sky, where you can explore different books (websites) with the help of your special web browser.
